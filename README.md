# meterthingy

GPIO control over analog meters.

Setting a value in a text file results in the meter showing that value.

Currently, meterthingy is specific to the RaspberryPi.

ToDo:
1) Make it work with systems other than the RaspberryPi.
2) Adding scaling feature. It currently works with 0-100 scale.
3) Refactor!
