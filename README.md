# meterthingy

Control an analog meter with your RaspberryPi.

Setting a value in a text file results in the meter showing that value.

Currently, meterthingy is specific to the RaspberryPi.

ToDo:
1) Refactor. (Add comments, etc.)
2) Add scaling feature. It currently works with 0-100 scale.
3) Make it work with systems other than the RaspberryPi.
